Description:
Display Case is a customizable multiple Indicator package that is usable right out of the box or can be modified to include your favorite oscillators, moving averages, or anything else! The display case dimensions and colors can be user defined in the Settings menu, as well as the candle length and heights of each indicator so they can be stacked separately or together as desired. Finally, color matched labels are generated to easily reference each indicator and its value without having to clog the scale display or reference the Settings. This is a light resource indicator that won't bog your chart, but allow you to easily switch between some of the most popular indicators quickly and easily!
